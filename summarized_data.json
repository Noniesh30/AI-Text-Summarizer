      "text": "The **Ramayana** is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient Indian literature, the other being the *Mahabharata*. Composed by the sage **Valmiki**, the Ramayana is a poetic narrative that spans approximately 24,000 verses and is divided into seven books, known as **Kandas**. It tells the story of **Rama**, a prince of Ayodhya and the seventh incarnation of the Hindu god **Vishnu**, and is regarded as an ideal portrayal of dharma (righteousness), devotion, duty, and relationships.\n\nThe story begins with the **Balakanda**, which narrates the birth of Rama and his brothers\u2014Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna\u2014and their education under sage Vishwamitra. Rama wins the hand of **Sita**, the daughter of King Janaka, by stringing and breaking the divine bow of Lord Shiva. In the **Ayodhyakanda**, Rama\u2019s stepmother Kaikeyi demands that her son Bharata be crowned king instead, and Rama be exiled for fourteen years. Honoring his father Dasharatha\u2019s promise, Rama leaves for the forest accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana.\n\nThe **Aranyakanda** recounts their life in the forest and the events leading to the abduction of Sita by the demon king **Ravana** of Lanka. In the **Kishkindhakanda**, Rama befriends the monkey prince **Hanuman** and the vanara king **Sugriva**, and together they begin the search for Sita. The **Sundarakanda** is a highlight of Hanuman's journey to Lanka, where he finds Sita imprisoned in Ashoka Vatika, gives her Rama\u2019s message, and burns part of the city before returning.\n\nThe **Yuddhakanda** or book of war details the epic battle between Rama\u2019s forces and Ravana\u2019s army in Lanka. With the help of Hanuman, the vanaras, and his brother Lakshmana, Rama defeats Ravana and rescues Sita. The final book, **Uttarakanda**, describes their return to Ayodhya and Rama\u2019s coronation. However, due to public doubt about Sita\u2019s purity, she is exiled, and eventually, she seeks refuge in the hermitage of sage Valmiki, where she gives birth to Rama\u2019s sons, Lava and Kusha.\n\nThe Ramayana is not just a story of a heroic journey; it is a philosophical and moral guide that has deeply influenced Indian culture, religion, art, and literature. It has been adapted into countless versions in various Indian languages, as well as in Southeast Asian cultures such as those of Indonesia, Thailand, and Cambodia. The characters\u2014Rama, Sita, Hanuman, Lakshmana, and Ravana\u2014have become archetypes, and the epic continues to be revered and retold through literature, theater, television, and oral traditions.\n",
